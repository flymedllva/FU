I love savoury muffins, too, and these are sooo delicious! I used only 2 onions (and I think it was quite enough!) and instead of self-rising flour, I used all-purpose flour plus 3 ts of baking powder and 1 scant ts of salt. Also chopped up one chicken breast instead of three thighs as that's what I had. Next time I think I'll use a bit more cilantro - couldn't really taste it and I'd like to!

These aren't quite fudge-like, but like thin, moist brownies, which is close enough to fudge for me.  I made a couple subs and used whole wheat pastry flour instead of unbleached, wheat bran instead of oat bran, sucanat instead of sugar, 1 egg and half an egg's worth of soyflour egg substitute instead of just whites and walnuts instead of pecans.  I didn't find these to have the rubbery texture that low-fat baked goods so often have and they're really dark and chocolatey.  The bran, I think, gave it a nice lighter texture, and kept it from being too dense.  You can't really taste the sweet potato in the final product, but I think it really contributes to the final flavor.  Great little dessert and very satisfying even from a small piece.

A way to tell if the oil is hot is to wet your figertips with water and splash the oil.  If it boils immediatly, then the oilis hot, and if it takes more than 3-6 seconds, then you should let it heat a little longer.  Good Luck and Enjoy!

I believe it has great potential, it\\'s quick, easy and satisfied a late night craving.  But as many of the five star reviews point out, it does need a little tweaking.  The flavor is bland, next time I will add some vanilla and increase the salt a little.  Also, the batter is too thick, needing more milk.  I used peanut oil to fry them since it has a higher smoking point than vegetable oil, and I mixed the ingredients together in the blender.  I used a ziplock bag with a corner cut out for pouring as there was no way the batter was going through my 1/4\" funnel.  Rather than using water to test the heat of the oil as one reviewer suggested (that made the oil pop and splatter, next time I\\'ll test it with a bit of batter.

Comments: Added a dash of vanilla.  I used grape seed oil because it has a high smoke point and is light.  I reduced the recipe to 2 and still had leftover batter which I saved and will try that to see how well it holds up.  I used a funnel inserted into the top of a baster tube (no bulb) for better control and it worked well.  I used a medium sized cast iron skillet which gave just the right size per cake and reduced the  amt. of the oil.  I hand whisked the whole thing which I prefer to do when possible.  There&#039;s no oil temp indicated on recipe... I started on high and reduced to med. high but this will vary according to your stove.  Too hot will turn edges dark, too low and it absorbs too much oil before browning.  I&#039;d err on the side of too little batter per fry versus too much which end up with one big, solid cake.  Will follow up with success of using leftover batter for a second round.

This is the recipe he decided on and was it ever yummy!  There were only 3 of us eating tonight so I only purchased 1 fillet which was 1 Â¼ pounds.  My DH adusted the recipe for 3 servingsâ€¦ so perhaps we had more topping than the recipe intended but we thought it was a perfect amount.  He used a liberal shake of red pepper flakes in lieu of cayenne pepper.   The recipe did not mention anything about the skin.....my DH placed the haddock skin-side down in the baking dish, and hoped the fish would seperate from the skin like it does when grilling.  However the skin came along with the fillet so we just took our bites from the top, scraping them off the skin.  I think I'll ask the fish guy to remove the skin for me next time I buy haddock.   My 12 year old DS thought the fish was too spicy, not â€˜spicy hotâ€™ but just too spicy.  We scraped the topping off but he still just pickedâ€¦.his loss!  DH served with basmati rice and a salad.

I love Key Lime Pie better than anything and I've had some very good and some not so good.  This recipe is, by far, the best key lime filling I have ever tasted.  I love how the sour cream mellows the taste of the sweetened condensed milk.  So many recipes just call for the condensed milk, egg yolks and lime juice and to me the condensed milk taste is more predominate over the lime flavor.  Not so with this recipe.  I did leave out the rum this time, but next time I will add it.  The coconut crust was quite tasty also but for those who don't like coconut a regular graham cracker/vanilla wafer crust will work perfectly. Thank you so much for this recipe.

I&#039;ll probably pull it out the next time I make it in favor of paprika.  I also as suggested by other&#039;s halved the salt.  And that worked for me when I put it in the gumbo.  Soups tradtionally have tons of sodium, so the folks that are panicking about the salt can use less if they want.  But I do like this spice recipe, a nice flavor, and you can really tell the freshness of it being newly made.  I would say this is more of a cajun spice than a creole spice.

Because I had 5 drumsticks and 5 thighs, I tripled the recipe, but doubling it would have been enough.  I lined the pan with aluminum foil and sprayed with cooking spray for an easier cleanup.  Found that flipping the chicken every 15 minutes or so kept it from sticking too much.  Very nice - crispy, tasty and little effort.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I would add more of the called for seasonings to the flour as called for plus whatever you wanted besides. It was easy no doubt,..but ended up having to disconnect my smoke alarm as the flour burning on the pan set it off., and yes it was a light coating. This recipe does work and makes juicy chicken on the cheap and quick, just remember to add seasoning to your tastes, don't leave any excess flour on the cooking sheet as it will burn and smoke, not badly mind you but enough to make you wish you had known it before. You may want to cover the cooking sheets in foil as it does stick and would make for easier cleanup.
